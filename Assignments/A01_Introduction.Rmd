## 1) Discussion Questions

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: Although I have taken an Introduction to R course as an undergraduate student, I have never worked with Git before. While I was an undergraduate student, I also worked a research fellow where I had the opportunity to use r to create visuals (i.e., graphs) for datasets.

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I am pretty familiar with R Markdown/knitting and loading in datasets/csv files into R!

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: I am pretty nervous to perform an analysis with R since I am only familiar with certain codes!


## 2) GitHub

Provide a link below to your forked course repository in GitHub. Make sure you have pulled all recent changes from the course repository  and that you have updated your course README file.
